## Contributing to Sandbox

I'm truly glad you're interested in contributing to **Sandbox**!  
If you've tried the tool and found a **bug**, or have an **idea to improve the application**, please feel free to **open an issue** in the repository â€” I'd be happy to take a look and discuss it with you.

All **pull requests** are welcome.  
I'm not an absolute expert myself, so I'm more than happy to collaborate and discuss the best way to bring your idea or improvement to life. Learning together is part of the process!

### A few guidelines for contributing:

- Before submitting a PR, make sure your code is well-structured and, if possible, includes tests or usage examples.
- If you're proposing a larger feature or significant change, consider opening an issue first to discuss the idea.
- Keep your code clean and consistent with the project's style.
